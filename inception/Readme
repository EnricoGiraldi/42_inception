🏗️ Project Overview
Inception is a Docker-based system administration project at 42 School. The goal is to create a containerized infrastructure where each service runs in its own Docker container, orchestrated with Docker Compose.

By the end of the project, you will have a secure, scalable web server setup running multiple services inside containers.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Learn Docker and Docker Compose.
✅ Set up a secure web server with TLS/SSL.
✅ Deploy WordPress as a CMS inside a container.
✅ Set up a MariaDB database for WordPress.
✅ Implement data persistence using Docker volumes.
✅ Separate services into isolated containers.

📁 Project Structure
Each service runs in its own container, defined in the docker-compose.yml file:

Service	Description
NGINX	Web server with SSL/TLS
WordPress	CMS for website management
MariaDB	Database for WordPress
Redis	Cache for improving performance
Adminer	Web interface to manage the database
FTPS	Secure FTP server
Bonus Services	Additional optional features
All services must be persistent, meaning data should not be lost after restarting the containers.

🛠️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copia
Modifica
git clone https://github.com/your-username/inception.git
cd inception
2️⃣ Create Required Directories

✨ Bonus Features
To earn extra points, you can implement:

⭐ Redis caching for faster database queries.
⭐ FTPS server for secure file transfers.
⭐ Container log monitoring for debugging.

🔐 Security & Best Practices
📌 SSL/TLS Encryption: You must configure a certificate to secure the website.
📌 Docker Volumes: Ensure correct volume setup to prevent data loss.
📌 Permissions & Access Control: Secure database and CMS credentials properly.
